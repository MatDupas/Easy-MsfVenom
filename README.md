Easy-MsfVenom - V1



Goal: search, generate & deliver payloads in an quick and easy way
Be as simple as possible BUT with all msfvenom payloads.

* ever lost some time by searching the right payload ? Use the fast filter
* Tired of inputing your IP, and defaults settings ? let Easy-MsfVenom do it for you
* Want only staged  payloads ? only Meterpreter ones ?  ask for it
* want more complex options ? want a hidden_tcp ? you find them

#  Features 
* fast search through all Venom payloads
* filter by Meterpreter / Bind / Reverse / architecture ... 
* integrated easy delivery
	- Http server for Bind shells
* Integrated listener for Reverse shells
	- launch of Msfconsole handler for Metasploit payloads
	- Launch of netcat listener for other payloads 



# Usage

# TO-DO:
[] Add encoders with fast filters and batch payloads encoding
[
 


# Requirement
* Python 3.x
* Metasploit-framework

# Installation

> git clone
> cd Easy-msfVenom
> install.sh

# Upgrade
To keep Easy-MsfVenom synchronized with all MsfVenom payloads, just do:

> ./easy-MsfVenom --upgrade

Note: it is useful to also keep metasploit-framework updated
sudo apt update; sudo apt install metasploit-framework
(it is better to make  backup before upgrading, just in case...)
